#Shade

A stealth game with light mechanics.

##Mechanics

###Light
The overall idea I've had for light mechanics is to actually have the player's eyes adapt to the dark/light. If the player chooses to stay in the darkness they will be able to see better in the dark, but will be blinded by any sudden light.

I'll likely base this on real eyes; in light rods will become blanched whilst cones will be able to pick up coloured light. In dark cones will struggle to pick up any light, but rods will begin to work again and pick up light intensities.

I'm also likely to want to have different races with different traits; one owl-like race who have a lot more rods than Humans, one agile race for more daytime play.

I'm thinking having a day/night timer of about 10-30 minutes. Any missions will actually be expected to complete within X days and can be failed (with consequences).
